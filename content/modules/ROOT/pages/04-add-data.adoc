To understand how we organize databases, it is helpful to understand the
definition of a relational database, a relational database management
system, and SQL. For an overview,

helpful article.]

In this step, you will be challenged to complete a task, and we will
provide you with guidance to help you along!

== Challenge: Make a database to organize the items in your home

To record all of the items in your home, there are many ways to organize
the database. For our lab, we will use this database design:
image:../assets/Home_Database_Diagram.png[Home inventory database
design] In this diagram: * Each item has a name, an ID number, a value,
and a location (room) where it is stored. The location (room) of the
item is a foreign key because it relates to the Room entity. The ID
number is auto-incrementing and is the primary key for items. * Each
room has a name, which is the primary key for the room entity. Each room
also has a Size field to store the area.

Now that you are familiar with the database you will build, you are
ready to start creating tables.

Next, create the table for `+Room+` with the following command:

[source,sql,run]
----
CREATE TABLE Room(
Name varchar (255) NOT NULL,
Size int,
PRIMARY KEY (Name)
);
----

Now create the table for `+Item+`.

[source,sql,run]
----
CREATE TABLE Item(
  Room varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  Name varchar(255),
  ID_number int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  Value DOUBLE,
  PRIMARY KEY(ID_number),
  FOREIGN KEY (Room) REFERENCES Room(Name)
);
----

Finally, run the following command to insert some entries into your
database. In the real world, you will customize the entries depending on
your needs, but for the purpose of demonstration, run this MySQL
command:

[source,sql,run]
----
INSERT INTO Room(Name, Size)
VALUES('Living Room',500);
INSERT INTO Room(Name, Size)
VALUES('Bedroom',200);
INSERT INTO Room(Name, Size)
VALUES('Kitchen',400);
INSERT INTO Item(Room, Name, Value)
VALUES('Kitchen','Oven', 1000);
INSERT INTO Item(Room, Name, Value)
VALUES('Kitchen','Microwave',100);
INSERT INTO Item(Room, Name, Value)
VALUES('Bedroom','Bed',500);
INSERT INTO Item(Room, Name, Value)
VALUES('Living Room','Chair',500);
----

In the next step, youâ€™ll be able to see what you have just built! First,
quit your MySQL session by running the following command:

[source,sql,run]
----
quit;
----
