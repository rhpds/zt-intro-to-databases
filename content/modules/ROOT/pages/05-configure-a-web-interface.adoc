SQL servers are easiest to manage through the terminal, but when you are
first getting started, sometimes a GUI can make things less
intimidating. In your own SQL server, you can choose to skip the
configuration of a GUI, but we’ll set up the GUI in our lab.

We will use Adminer, but you can also use tools like phpMyAdmin and
MySQL Workstation.

To install Adminer, run the following command to install php and the php
MySQL extension. These are required to successfully run Adminer.

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf install -y php php-mysqli
----

Next, run the following command to make a directory for Adminer and use
it as your working directory:

[source,bash,run]
----
mkdir /var/www/html/adminer && cd /var/www/html/adminer
----

To download Adminer from its GitHub repository into the directory you
made, run this command:

[source,bash,run]
----
wget -O index.php https://github.com/vrana/adminer/releases/download/v4.8.1/adminer-4.8.1-en.php
----

Next, configure Adminer’s ownership and permissions:

[source,bash,run]
----
chown -R apache:apache index.php /var/www/html/adminer/
chmod -R 775 /var/www/html/adminer/
----

To complete the installation, restart the web server through
`+systemctl restart+`:

[source,bash,run]
----
systemctl restart httpd
----

Now, go ahead and select the `+Adminer+` tab at the top of your Instruqt
window.

Log in with the following settings: * System: `+MySQL+` * Server:
`+localhost+` * Username: `+root+` * Password: `+rhel+` * Database:
`+MyDatabase+`

You will now see the tables you created earlier:
